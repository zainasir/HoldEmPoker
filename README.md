# Poker Project (Binghamton University)

This is a repository of the Poker Project I completed as part of the CS 220 (Architecture from a Programming Perspective) course under the direction of Professor Aravind Prakash. 

This project's aim was to create a program that evaluates the winner of a 2-player Texas Holdem' poker game. Final program was tested on 100,000 inputs and was able to successfuly decide the winning hand for 100% of the inputs.

Instructions:  
- Compile: `gcc poker.c -o poker -ansi -g`
- Run: `./poker sample_input > sample_output`
